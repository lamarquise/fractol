Ok so the way things work now:

t_img named mlx contains all info for making the window, a pointer to t_cord named dim 
which contains input size of boxes and # of boxes, a pointer to t_mag named img
which contains img ptr and # of pix of img and pointer to t_car named tab, which
contains a table with x y coord of start of all boxes to be made

seems like t_car table is only useful for production of first img, then not so useful,
move it? I think so

what is int *tab for ???
tab does what car does ...
tab used in draw, contains the pixel number for start of each box
car not that usefull... i think
